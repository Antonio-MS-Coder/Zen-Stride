# ZenStride - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** ZenStride
**Product Type:** Mobile App
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 21/8/2025

## 2. Problem Statement

Busy professionals struggle to maintain consistent progress toward their personal goals because small daily achievements go unnoticed and motivation wanes without clear visual feedback on their cumulative impact. They need a digital companion that transforms incremental efforts—like reading 10 pages, exercising 15 minutes, or learning 5 new words—into compelling visual progress tracking that demonstrates how these micro-wins compound into significant long-term achievements. This solution would increase goal completion rates by making abstract progress tangible and sustaining motivation through visual reinforcement of accumulated gains."

Key improvements made:
-Specific audience: "busy professionals" instead of generic users
- **Clear pain point**: difficulty seeing how small efforts add up, leading to motivation loss
- **Concrete examples**: specific activities and timeframes
- **Quantifiable outcome**: "increase goal completion rates"
- **Actionable focus**: visual progress tracking that shows compounding effects

This version gives stakeholders a clear understanding of who you're serving, what problem you're solving, and the expected impact.
